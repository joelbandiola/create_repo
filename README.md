#Assigment to creat repo.
Instructions:
1.  Create a repository from my github account.
2.  Using Git Bash I used - git clone git@github.com:joelbandiola/create_repo.git command
 (copying repository from github to your computer)
3.  I'm using Windows you can "right click the cloned 
folder from github then click git bash here"
4.  Create the following files using touch command:
- readme.md (this is used to explain what the codes all 
about or to give an instructions)
- .gitignore (it can be used not to include the file to 
staging area)
- hello.py (python program that displays " Hello World!"
5.  Then used the following commands:
- git status (displays the state of the files and staging 
area)
- git add (this will add the files to staging area)
- git commit (taking the files from staging area and 
commit it locally or to your computer, still not pushed 
any files changes to remote server - github)
- git push (this will now push committed changes to remote 
server - github)
